                                   TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.

It is specific to the Muldis D specification distribution only, and doesn't
talk about things that would go in other distributions, including
implementations.  (But, look at lib/Muldis/D/See_Also.pod for a list of
actual or possible implementations.)

See also the file TODO_DRAFT which contains a large amount of brainstorming
that isn't suitable for a normal TODO file; TODO_DRAFT only exists in the
Muldis D version control repository, not in the packaged Muldis D
distributions on CPAN; you can go to the version control to read it.

* Track Muldis::D::Ref_Eng and otherwise rewrite any outstanding sections of
the Muldis D spec so they're up to date with the post-mid-2011 conceptions.

* Release "alpha" status Muldis::D and Muldis::D::Ref_Eng distributions
simultaneously, when they are in sync and each is functionally complete
enough to be a useful useable programming language in test or dev setups.

* Spin off the HDMD_Perl_STD and HDMD_Raku_STD languages into separate
spec distros / version control; https://github.com/muldis/Muldis-D-Perl
arguably is exactly where the first one should go for example;
then Muldis-D distro only defines PT_STD.

* Whatever else needs doing, such as, fixing bugs.
